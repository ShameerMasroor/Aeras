---8th December---
Included the gt_pose and error publisher into the sjtu launch file
Set up RVIZ config file such that only a single one is needed for our work
Modified the gt_pose function to publish errors and rmse.


---9th December ---

Reduced the lidar resolution to speed up the simulation
Introduced a 50x50 world for gazebo. 
Cleaned the playground world.
Increased max time step from 0.001 to 0.003. This speeds up the simulation
Made relatime settings '0'. This makes the simulation run as fast as possible.

15th Jan
Full autonomy achieved

14th Feb:

Thermal camera view and ray casting can now be observed on RVIZ




--- 1st March ---

1. Turned off gui on Gazebo
2. Tweaked the Gazebo launch file to make use of sensor performance tricks.
3. World physics engine tweaked.
4. FASTLIO now publishes its path faster. The pose is extracted from the path.
This overall sped up the simulation


--- 11th March ---

1. Added a node to the octomap package that tracks the exploration percentage
2. Increased octomap resolution to 0.9m from 0.5m. 


--- 31st March ---
1. Added thermal based exploration

--- 1st April ---

1. Added markers for heat signature visualization
2. Added an option to continue or stop the mission
3. A circle is now defined around the region where the person is probable to be found.
4. New thermal model added
5. After selection of a frontier in thermal exploration based on angle, the selection is further refined by selecting of a candidate that most closely aligns with the angle of the object detected.
6. Confidence score checker implemented. It stops the mission when a certain confidence score is exceeded, and asks to whether continue the mission or stop it.

--- 2nd April ---

1. An issue was noted with the OMPL node where no path was being published after being requested. The node was reworked, and the issue was resolved.
2. Drone yaw now follows heat signature when detected.
