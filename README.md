# üå≤ Aeras ‚Äì Multi-UAV SAR System with LI-SLAM & FASTLIO2

Welcome to **Aeras** ‚Äì a modular, simulation-ready, multi-UAV system for **Search and Rescue (SAR)** in complex **forest environments**. Developed at **Habib University** as a final-year Capstone Project, Aeras integrates cutting-edge SLAM, path planning, and human detection technologies under one unified framework.

Built with **ROS2 (Humble)**, **Gazebo Classic**, and real-time LiDAR-thermal SLAM pipelines, Aeras is purpose-designed for GPS-denied, under-canopy scenarios where traditional SAR efforts struggle.

## üß≠ Overview

**Aeras** addresses the core challenges of forest SAR operations:

- üö´ GPS-denied conditions  
- üå≤ Occlusion from canopy and dense vegetation  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Visual aliasing and unreliable communication

Our system leverages **LiDAR, IMU, and thermal cameras** mounted on UAVs to enable:

- Real-time **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**  
- **Thermal-aware exploration** and victim detection  
- Multi-agent **autonomous navigation** and **teleoperation** support
